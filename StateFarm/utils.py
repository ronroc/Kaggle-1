# **Some OpenCV functions (beyond those introduced in the lesson) that might be useful for this project are:**
# 
# `cv2.inRange()` for color selection  
# `cv2.fillPoly()` for regions selection  
# `cv2.line()` to draw lines on an image given endpoints  
# `cv2.addWeighted()` to coadd / overlay two images
# `cv2.cvtColor()` to grayscale or change color
# `cv2.imwrite()` to output images to file  
# `cv2.bitwise_and()` to apply a mask to an image

# **Check out the OpenCV documentation to learn about these and discover even more awesome functionality!**

# ## Test on Videos
# 
# You know what's cooler than drawing lanes over images? Drawing lanes over video!
# 
# We can test our solution on two provided videos:
# 
# `solidWhiteRight.mp4`
# 
# `solidYellowLeft.mp4`
# 
# **Note: if you get an `import error` when you run the next cell, try changing your kernel (select the Kernel menu above --> Change Kernel).  Still have problems?  Try relaunching Jupyter Notebook from the terminal prompt. Also, check out [this forum post](https://carnd-forums.udacity.com/questions/22677062/answers/22677109) for more troubleshooting tips.**

# ## Improve the draw_lines() function
# 
# **At this point, if you were successful with making the pipeline and tuning parameters, you probably have the Hough line segments drawn onto the road, but what about identifying the full extent of the lane and marking it clearly as in the example video (P1_example.mp4)?  Think about defining a line to run the full length of the visible lane based on the line segments you identified with the Hough Transform. As mentioned previously, try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines. You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video "P1_example.mp4".**
# 
# **Go back and modify your draw_lines function accordingly and try re-running your pipeline. The new output should draw a single, solid line over the left lane line and a single, solid line over the right lane line. The lines should start from the bottom of the image and extend out to the top of the region of interest.**
